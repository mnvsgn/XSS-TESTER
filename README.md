## Overview

XSS-TESTER is an interactive web-based platform that enables developers to practice, demonstrate, and evaluate vulnerabilities such as XSS and CSRF within a controlled environment. It provides real-time security toggling, payload testing, and comprehensive logging to facilitate learning and security assessment.

### Why XSS-TESTER?

This project helps developers understand and improve web security by simulating attack scenarios and visualizing payloads. The core features include:

- üõ°Ô∏è **Toggle Security Features:** Dynamically enable or disable protections like input sanitization and CSRF defenses.

- üîç **Payload Testing Environment:** Submit and evaluate XSS and CSRF payloads to assess vulnerability levels.

- üìä **Logging & Visualization:** Review submitted inputs and payload logs through intuitive web interfaces.

- üéØ **Educational Focus:** Demonstrate security best practices and common attack vectors in a hands-on manner.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Core Server Functionality:** Manage user interactions, session states, and security controls
